* Better HTML display of result : list of nodes or a single node ?

* elaborate idea of  HTML --> data --> HTML idempotent operation
  - first step scraping : selection + extraction
  - template + rules + data to get back the HTML
  - define full template from any web page (css + script remained untouched)

* scraping with multiple extractions : complete version of the 4pb


* organize all enlive functions into several categories :
  - selectors : union, intersection, predicates
  - transformers
  - misc : utilities , internal

* cache menu

* better HMTL display show it like a tree instead of a plain text

* internals :
  - derivation
  - state-machine : explain how selector are map to a  fsm
  - mapknit
